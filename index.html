                <p>A result oriented professional with experience in mortgage industry; an academic achiever and a motivated individual who wants to pursue a career in IT field. </p>
                <p>In my leisure time, I like to play guitar. I collect guitar pedals and consider myself being a Pedal Junkie. Spend most of my time researching about Guitar Pedals. I love to code because I find this similar to my guitar playing. The more skill I ca achieve the better output I can produce in both. Just like any craftmanship, both requires persistence to master the skills. </p>
                <p><b>A Fun Fact about me is:</b> I used to play bass in a heavy metal band in Bangladesh, my home country. Those days were awesome! I feel fascinated about coding. I believe coding, in general programming, is an amazing tool(sorcery), with which we can instruct a dumb machine to do some work for us. What else can be this close to magic?!  </p>
